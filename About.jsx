              My journey into the world of technology began with a profound
              fascination for problem-solving and the ever-evolving landscape of
              programming languages. From my roots in Electrical Engineering at
              the esteemed National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, to my
              current endeavors as a Full Stack Developer, my love for crafting
              seamless digital experiences has only grown.

              Proficient in JavaScript, Next.js,Prisma and GraphQL, I bring
              forth a robust foundation in modern web technologies. My

              coupled with hands-on experience in MongoDB, Firebase, and a suite

              Beyond the realm of code, I foster essential soft skills crucial
              for collaborative success. Time management, effective
              communication, and the ability to navigate challenges with
              resilience are facets I actively nurture.
